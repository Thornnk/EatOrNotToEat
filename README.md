# Introduction
---
This is my very first project as a Full Stack Developer. It was made for the Front-end module of the Ironhack Remote bootcamp in just 5 days.

# The game
---

The goal of the game is to survive in the wild. To stay alive you need to keep in line your hunger and thirst. If one of the stats reaches 0, you die. There is quite a bit of randomness behind the scenes so good luck üòÅ

To play you only need to move and click the cursor. ![mouse-image](https://i.ibb.co/NLsFS8T/1994612.png)
