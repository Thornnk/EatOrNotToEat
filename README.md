# Introduction
---
This is my very first project as a Full Stack Developer. It was made for the Front-end module of the Remote bootcamp in Ironhack just within 5 days.

# The game
---

The goal of the game is about surviving into the wild. To keep you alive you need to keep to line your hunger and thirst. If one of the stats reaches 0, you die. There is quite a bit of randomness behindscenes so good luck üòÅ

To play you only need to move and click the cursor. ![mouse-image](https://i.ibb.co/NLsFS8T/1994612.png)
